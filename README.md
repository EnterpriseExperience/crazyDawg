## UPDATE:
If you DO use the config located in this repository named: IY_FE_Y.iy | it will automatically detect the file separately (this is my config for emotes, and such, for like MIC UP), feel free to use it!

## IF YOU WANT TO USE THE CUSTOM MADE CONFIG, FIRST COPY AND PASTE (CELERY):

'%localappdata%\Temp\celery\workspace'

## AND PASTE THE FILE TO THIS DIRECTORY^^

## CUSTOM MADE CONFIG PLACE (SOLARA):

'%USERPROFILE%\Desktop'

## AND FIND YOUR SOLARA FOLDER AND GO TO "workspace" AND PASTE IT IN THE FOLDER

## ANY OTHER EXECUTORS, JUST GO INTO THEIR MAIN FOLDERS AND FIND A "workspace" FOLDER AND PASTE IT IN.
