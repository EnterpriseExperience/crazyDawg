`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseExperience/crazyDawg/main/InfYieldOther.lua", true))()`

## UPDATE (v1):
If you DO use the config located in this repository named: IY_FE.iy | use instructions below (this is my config for emotes, and such, for idk), feel free to use it!

## IF YOU WANT TO USE THE CUSTOM MADE CONFIG, FIRST COPY AND PASTE (CELERY):

`%localappdata%\Temp\celery\workspace`

## AND PASTE THE FILE TO THIS DIRECTORY^^

## CUSTOM MADE CONFIG PLACE (SOLARA):

(IF THE FOLDER IS ON YOUR DESKTOP):
`%USERPROFILE%\Desktop`
(IF THE FOLDER IS IN YOUR DOWNLOADS):
`%USERPROFILE%\Downloads`
(IF THE FOLDER IS IN YOUR DOCUMENTS):
`%USERPROFILE%\Documents`
OR FIND THE (SOLARA) FOLDER ELSEWHERE

## AND FIND YOUR SOLARA FOLDER AND GO TO "workspace" AND PASTE IT IN THE FOLDER

## ANY OTHER EXECUTORS, JUST GO INTO THEIR MAIN FOLDERS AND FIND A "workspace" FOLDER AND PASTE IT IN.

## AND IF YOUR IN-GAME WHILE REPLACING THE `IY_FE.iy` FILE, CLOSE ROBLOX AND REOPEN, AND MAKE SURE TO DELETE OLD `IY_FE.iy` FILE TO!
